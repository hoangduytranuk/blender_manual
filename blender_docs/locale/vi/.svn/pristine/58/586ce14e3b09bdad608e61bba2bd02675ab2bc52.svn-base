"In *Pose Mode*, bones behave like objects. So the transform actions "
"(move/rotate/scale, etc.) are very similar to the same ones in Object "
"Mode (all available ones are regrouped in the :menuselection:`Pose --> "
"Transform` submenu). However, there are some important specificities:"

"The \"transform center\" of a given bone (i.e. its default pivot point, "
"when it is the only selected one) is *its root*. Note by the way that "
"some pivot point options seem to not work properly. In fact, except for "
"the *3D Cursor* one, all others appear to always use the median point of "
"the selection (and not e.g. the active bone's root when *Active Object* "
"is selected, etc.)."

"As previously noted, bones' transformations are performed based on the "
"*Rest Position* of the armature, which is its state as defined in *Edit "
"Mode*. This means that in rest position, in *Pose Mode*, each bone has a "
"scale of 1.0, and null rotation and position (as you can see it in the "
"*Transform* panel, in the 3D Views)."

"Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one "
"(visible when you enable the *Axes* option of the *Armature* panel). This"
" is especially important when using axis locking, for example, there is "
"no specific \"bone roll\" tool in *Pose Mode*, as you can rotate around "
"the bone's main axis just by locking on the local Y axis :kbd:`R Y Y`... "
"This also works with several bones selected; each one is locked to its "
"own local axis!"

"When you pose your armature, you are supposed to have one or more objects"
" skinned on it! And obviously, when you transform a bone in *Pose Mode*, "
"its related objects or object's shape is moved/deformed accordingly, in "
"real-time. Unfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy"
" skin object, this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very "
"painful. If you experience such troubles, try enabling the *Delay Deform*"
" button of the *Armature* panel the skin objects will only be updated "
"once you validate the transform operation."
