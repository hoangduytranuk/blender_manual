msgid "This mode displays a graph showing the distribution of color information in the pixels of the currently displayed image. The X axis represents values of pixel, from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 255), while the Y axis represents the number of pixels in that tonal range. A predominantly dark image would have most of its information toward the left side of the graph."
