msgid "Explode Modifier"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:7
msgid "The *Explode* modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry by moving/rotating its faces in a way that roughly tracks particles emitted by that object, making it look as if the mesh is being exploded (broken apart and pushed outward)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:11
msgid "For this modifier to have any visible effect, there needs to be a particle system on its object. That particle system will control how the mesh is exploded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:14
msgid "Both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how granular the *Explode* modifier is. More faces and more particles will mean more individual pieces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:23
msgid "Here is a `demo blend-file <https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/File:Manual_-_Explode_Modifier_-_Exploding_Cube_-_2.5.blend>`__ showing a cube with a particle system and *Explode* modifier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:29
msgid "The *Explode* modifier must come after the *Particle System* one in the :ref:`modifier stack <modifier-stack>`, in order for the former to get required data from the later."

msgid "Vertex Group"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:42
msgid "Vertices in this group may not be affected by the *Explode* modifier. Vertices with full weight are not affected at all, while vertices with less weight have a higher chance of being affected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:46
msgid "Vertices with null weight will be treated like those which do not belong to the group at all, and explode normally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:54
msgid "Protect"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:50
msgid "Clean vertex group edges. Depending on the weights assigned to that vertex group, either completely protect those faces from being affected by the *Explode* modifier (which would happen if the faces had a weight value of 1), or completely remove protection from those faces (which would happen if the faces had a weight value of 0)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Particle UV"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:57
msgid "If set, the U value of the coordinates in that :term:`UV map` will be overwritten with the age of the particle attached to the matching mesh face (in proportion, from 0 for not yet born particles, to 1 for dead ones)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:61
msgid "The V value is set to a constant 0.5 value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:63
msgid "This allows e.g. to make the color of a fragment (face) vary during it 'explosion' phase, by using a texture with a gradient of colors along its *U* axis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:68
msgid "Cut Edges"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:67
msgid "Split the mesh in pieces based on location of emitted particles, instead of using existing faces. This will typically give a splitting that appears more random."
