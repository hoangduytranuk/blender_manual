msgid "One important thing to understand about armature editing is that you edit the *rest position* of your armature, i.e. its \"default state\". An armature in its *rest position* has all bones with *no* rotation and scaled to 1.0 in their own local space."

msgid "The different :doc:`poses </animation/armatures/posing/index>` you might create afterwards are based on this rest position. So if you modify it in *Edit Mode*, all the poses already existing will also be modified. Thus you should in general be sure that your armature is definitive before starting to :doc:`skin </animation/armatures/skinning/index>` and :doc:`pose </animation/armatures/posing/index>` it!"
