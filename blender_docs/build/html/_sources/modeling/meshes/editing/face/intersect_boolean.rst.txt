   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Face --> Intersect (Boolean)`

Performs Boolean operations with the selection on the unselected geometry.
While the :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans` is useful for non-destructive edits,
access to these operations with a tool in Edit Mode can be useful to quickly perform edits.

Boolean
   Difference, Union, Intersect
Swap
   Changes the order of the operation.
Merge Threshold
   Tolerance for close faces to be considered touching,
   It may be useful to increase this when some intersections aren't detected that should be and
   when extra geometry is being created because edges aren't detected as overlapping.

   .. warning::

      A threshold approaching the size of faces may cause very slow calculation,
      in general keep this value small.
