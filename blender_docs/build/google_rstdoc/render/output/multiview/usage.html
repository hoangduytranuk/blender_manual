      Full Screen Stereo 3D Modes
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      If you have a 3D display most of the time,
you will use it to see in stereo 3D, you will have to go to the fullscreen mode.
In fact some modes will only work in the full window mode that hides most of the user
interface from the work area.
In this case it is recommended to work with two monitors,
using the 3D screen for visualizing the stereo result
while the other screen can be used for the regular Blender work.

    Stereo 3D Camera
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    When using the Stereo 3D scene view setup, a stereo pair is created
on-the-fly and used for rendering and previsualization.
For all the purposes this works as two cameras that share most parameters (focal length, clipping, …).
The stereo pair, however, is offsetted, and can have unique rotation and shift between itself.

       Multi-view images can be saved in special formats according to the production requirements.
By default the system saves each view as an individual file,
thus generating as many files as views to be rendered.
In stereo 3D productions, for the final deployment or
even intermediary previews it is convenient to save stereo 3D images,
that are ready to use with 3D displays or simple anaglyph glasses.
The formats supported match the display modes available for the window.

       Some stereo 3D formats represent a considerable loss of data.
For example, the Anaglyph format will cap out entire color channels from the original image.
The Top-Bottom compressed will discard half of your vertical resolution data.
The Interlace will mash your data considerably.
Once you export in those formats, you can still import the image
back in Blender, for it to be treated as Stereo 3D.
You will need to match the window stereo 3D display mode to the image stereo 3D format though.

    Compositor
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    The Compositor works smoothly with multi-view images.
The compositing of a view is completed before the remaining views start to be composited.
The pipeline is the same as the single-view workflow, with the difference that you can use Images,
Movies or Image Sequences in any of the supported multi-view formats.

   <paragraph>
    The views to render are defined in the current scene views,
in a similar way as you define the composite output resolution in the current scene render panel,
regardless of the Image nodes resolutions or Render Layers from different scenes.

     Single-View Images
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If the image from an Image node does not have the view you are trying to render,
the image will be treated as a single-view image.

       If you need to treat the views separately, you can use
the

        <inline classes="doc">
         Switch View node
        </inline>
       </reference>
       to combine the views before an Output node.

     Performance
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     By default, when compositing and rendering from the user interface all views are rendered and then composited.
During test iterations you can disable all but one view from the Scene Views panel,
and re-enable it after you get the final look.
