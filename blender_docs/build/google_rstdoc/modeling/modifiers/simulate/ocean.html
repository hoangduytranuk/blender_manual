   Ocean Modifier

  <paragraph>
   The

    Ocean
   </emphasis>
   modifier is a tool to simulate and generate a deforming ocean surface,
and associated texture, used to render the simulation data.
It is intended to simulate deep ocean waves and foam.

   It is a port from the open source

    Baking
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Rather than simulating the ocean data live, it can be baked to files in a given directory.
When a simulation is baked, the simulator engine is completely bypassed,
and the modifier/texture retrieves all information from the baked files.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    Baking can be advantageous for a few reasons:
   </paragraph>
   <bullet_list bullet="-">
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>

     Data Files
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     Simulation data is stored as sequences of
     <literal>
      OpenEXR
     </literal>
     image maps,
one for each of displacement, normals, and foam (if enabled to be generated).
Upon loading the data from these baked files, when a frame of the bake sequence is read,
it is cached in memory. This means that accessing loaded frames subsequent times is fast,
not incurring the overhead of drive access.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Since these baked files are plain
     <literal>
      OpenEXR
     </literal>
     ’s,
they can also be opened and rendered in any other application or renderer that supports them.

     Baking Foam
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     Baking also provides improved foam capabilities. When simulating live,
the ocean simulator retrieves data for that current frame only. In the case of the foam map,
this represents the tips of wave crests for that given frame. In reality,
after foam is created by wave interactions,
it remains sitting on the top of the wave surface for a while, as it dissipates. With baking,
it is possible to approximate that behavior, by accumulating foam from previous frames,
leaving it remaining on the surface.

    Simulation Internals
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    The simulator itself uses FFT methods to generate 2D grids of simulation information internally,
very similar to 2D texture maps.
The simulator can generate three types of data: displacement, normals,
and extra data, that is used to calculate wave crest intersections (i.e. foam).
After simulation, these maps are used to displace the ocean surface geometry in 3D,
and also can be used for shading via the Ocean texture. The internal simulation engine is
multi threaded with OpenMP to take advantage of multiple cores.
